* Proposed a meta-learning method DDG-DA for concept drift adaptation. The meta-model learns to guide the retraining process of the base model by sample reweighting and aims to improve the performance of the base model on unseen test data.
* The meta-model improved performance by $11.3\%$ in the signal-based metrics, and $46.7\%$ in the portfolio-based metrics compared to the baseline.

It is now under review...
