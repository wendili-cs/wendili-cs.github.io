* Focused on a learning to learn problem, which aimed to automatically learn the hyperparameters of deep neural networks by using a LSTM-based predictor.
* The proposed LSTM-based predictor not only retains the successful historical examples but also learns from failure lessons, used ablation studies to determine its optimal architecture.
