* Propose a population-based hyperparameter tuning framework combining multi-task collaboration. For the tasks in the task pool, it can find hyperparameter configurations that work for the current task, which can also be put into use in other tasks after slightly re-tuned.
* The results show significant improvements in generalization abilities yielded by neural networks trained using our method and better performances achieved by the multi-task meta-learning concept.
