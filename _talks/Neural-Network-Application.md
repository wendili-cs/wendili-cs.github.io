* Focused on streaming imbalanced and concept drifting problems in the power system and smart grid, proposed a new incremental ensemble learning method to handle both issues.
* Applied the proposed method to the electricity pricing in Australia to predict whether the price of New South Wales would be higher or lower than that of Victorias in a 24-h period.
