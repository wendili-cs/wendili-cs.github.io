* Used an autoregressive, feed-forward network to predict future LiDAR point clouds.
* Demonstrated the project results as a poster "*Object Detection and Frame Prediction for Temporal LiDAR Data*" in the **BDD/BAIR Workshop** [[PDF]](https://wendili-cs.github.io/files/Frame_Predictions__An_Unsupervised_Method_for_Predicting_Future_LiDAR_Scans.pdf).
