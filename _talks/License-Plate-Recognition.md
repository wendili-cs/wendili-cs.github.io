* Applied domain adaptation to allow knowledge transfer from the original training environment (source domain) to various inference environments (target domain). Built a license plate recognition system based on `StreamLit`.
* Implemented traditional machine learning algorithms and domain adaptation algorithms (`DANN`, `CCSA`).
