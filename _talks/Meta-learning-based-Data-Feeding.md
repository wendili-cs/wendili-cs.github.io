**Supervisor: Xiao Yang**

* Developed and maintained the quant platform [*Qlib*](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib), a quantitative-research library for online trading.
* Focused on data feeding in stock market prediction. Proposed a meta-learning-based method to reweight samples. The meta-model learned to guide the retraining process of the base model by sample reweighting and aimed to improve the performance of the base model on unseen test data.
* Designed *Meta-Controller*, *Reweighter* frameworks in *Qlib*, and merged the meta-model into the frameworks.
* Finished an academic paper ([*page*](https://wendili-cs.github.io/publication/2022AAAI-DDG-DA)), it is accepted by AAAI 2022.
