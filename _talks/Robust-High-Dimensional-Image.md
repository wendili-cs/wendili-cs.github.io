* Aimed at the inaccuracy of the typical image-to-image models, used a data-driven way to disentangle the features.
* The fused model achieved greater intra-class variation than typical image-to-image models.
* Finished an academic paper "Robust High Dimensional Image Data Translation via Disentangled Feature Representations". [[PDF]](https://wendili-cs.github.io/files/Robust_High_Dimensional_Image_Data_Generation_via_Disentangled_Feature_Representations.pdf)
